<h2>About</h2>
<p>Tropical savannas – characterised by an open tree canopy over a continuous grass understorey – dominate large sections of the seasonally dry tropics. They are the most flammable biome on Earth, with around 20% burning in a typical year, and global fire activity is extremely strongly skewed towards the savannas. Fire is critical to the carbon cycle of savannas because, despite being a relatively productive biome, they store relatively little carbon as there are very high losses of carbon to the atmoshpere due to frequent fire. Consequently, savannas play a critical role in the global carbon cycle, and their geographic distribution is a key source of uncertainty in global carbon models. However, a major impediment to modelling the global distribution of savanna is the lack of globally-consistent vegetation maps. The greatest uncertainty lies in confusion over the identity of ‘mesic savanna’ (in Africa, Australia and South America) and ‘dry tropical forest’ (in India, South East Asia and Central America), both with relatively high tree cover and biomass, but also high grass biomass and fire frequencies.</p>
<p>Currently, we have excellent satellite imagery of the Earth, at a high resolution.  Automatic classification of this imagery to identify different vegetation types and ecosystems is difficult, however, especially on a global scale, and when natural vegetation occurs intermingled with human-modified agricultural and grazing land.  The human eye, even untrained, may have greater skill.</p>
<p>The aim of this project is to use readily available global satellite-derived datasets of tree cover, fire activity and land-use, to objectively classify tropical vegetation (predominantly into savanna and closed forest classes).  To do this <b>we need your help</b> - log in to SavannaClick and try your hand at vegetation identification, to help us build a global savanna map and improve our climate, vegetation and fire models.</p>

    <h2>Classification</h2>

  <p>This we app will show you a random scene selected from within possible savanna biomes around the globe.  Two different satellite data sets are provided <b>(ESRI and Bing)</b>, in case the image is missing, cloudy or unidentifiable in one view. Feel free to switch between the two alternate views to get a better understanding of the landscape. The red circle represents the area you are classifying, but <b>looking around the rest of the scene for context</b> (is this part of a farm?  Is this mangrove vegetation next to a river rather than savanna?) is useful. <b>You may also use the Zoom controls</b> to zoom out and look at the surrounding vegetation. Once you have decided on the category of the scene, click one of the six buttons to the left of the map and your classification will be recorded, and the map will move to the next site.</p>

  <h2>Savanna</h2>

  <p>Savanna ecosystems are grassy ecosystems with trees, but where the trees are spaced far enough apart that the canopy does not close and form a continuous cover.  This enables enough light to penetrate the canopy to allow for a continuous herbaceous and grassy layer to persist.  <img src="sav1.png" alt="Photo by Ethel Aardvark CC" align="left"/> Tropical savannas are common in northern Australia, sub-Saharan Africa, south-and central america and south-east asia.  These systems often exist in a matrix with other vegetation types, including dense tropical rainforest.  The boundary between savannas and desert and tree-less grassland is driven primarily by aridity. The boundary between savanna and rainforest vegetation is driven in some cases by water availability, where rainforest exists close to water courses or in sheltered moist valleys, and in other cases by fire.  Landscape fire is common in savannas, due to the high fuel load provided by the grass layer, and savanna trees tend to be fire tolerant and recover quickly after burning. In contrast, rainforest species are highly sensitive to fire and are killed easily, but the closed rainforest canopy prevents a flammable grass layer forming, and maintains a moister environment where fire is rare.  Therefore, tropical savannas and rainforest exist as <i>alternative stable states</i> within the same climate zone.  <img src="sav2.png" alt="Photo by Liv Unni Sodem CC" align="right"/>  Global models of vegetation occurrence and change have difficulty modeling the boundaries of savannas and rainforests because of the small scale of the vegetation matrix, and the difficulty of incorporating realistic fire models.  This project aims to collate a global map of savannas and the surrounding vegetation types to help validate and improve these global dynamic vegetation models.</p>

  <p>In the satellite and aerial imagery you will view, <b>savanna</b> is characterized by the visibility of individual tree canopies, with the understory of grass visible between the tree canopies. You may need to zoom closer in the view to see if grass is visible between the canopies, as in some circumstances it may look like a continuous canopy. Where canopies form a closed unit and no ground or grass is visible between them, the vegetation is most likely <b>rainforest</b> or some other form of closed forest. On the other hand, systems with very widely spaced trees (&lt;5% of the field with trees visible) can still be classified as savanna.  Here, the important determinant is the presence of clear human settlement; if roads, paddocks and buildings are clearly visible, the land may have been cleared and the former presence of savanna is uncertain, so these scenes should be classified into the <b>Rural/Cleared</b> category.</p>

  This table shows some examples of savanna scenes from around the world.

  <h2>Rainforest</h2>

  <p>Rainforest is characterized by a very dense, closed canopy, with multiple vegetation layers present underneath the canopy, but generally lacking in grasses.  Like savanna vegetation, it is common in tropical and sub-tropical climates.  In some areas, sharp transitions between open, grassy savanna vegetation and dense rainforest vegetation can be observed, as in this satellite image from northern Australia.</p>

  <img src="rf_trans.png" />

  <p>The rainforest environment has high water availability, exhibits high biodiversity, and tends to exclude fire, although when fire does occur it can trigger a permanent transition to an alternative vegetation type.  <img src="rf1.jpg" alt="Ben Sutherland CC" align="right" />  In satellite image classification, rainforest can sometimes be confused with coastal mangrove swamps, which also have a very dense, dark green appearance.  The key differentiation is the location (close to the ocean) and the presence of mud flats and salt pans within the vegetation.  In many areas of the world, rainforests have been cleared for agricultural development.  Small rainforest remnants remain within a matrix of farms and grazing lands.  These remnants should be classified as cleared vegetation. <b>Be aware</b> that dense plantations of trees may appear as rainforests due to their closed canopies - see if you can determine if the trees are planted in organised rows or patterns. If so, it's likely you're looking at a plantation rather than a rainforest.</p>

  <h2>Unknown</h2>

  <p>Not all areas of the earth are equally covered by high-resolution satellite imagery.  You will occasionally come across scenes where images are missing, or where cloud obscures the scene, or which are otherwise unidentifiable as a distinct land use or vegetation type, or where you may be unsure of the classification. Check the region in both the <b>Bing</b> and <b>ESRI</b> data sets, but if the scene can't be identified, click the <b>Unknown</b> option.</p>

  <tr><td><img src="uk_tile2.png" /></td><td>No satellite imagery available.</td></tr>
  </table>

  <h2>Rural, Urban and Cleared</h2>

  <p>The tropical and sub-tropical climate zones have high human population densities and extensive agricultural and urban development.  Natural vegetation is therefore often highly modified, with clearing of of both dense rainforest and savanna for conversion to agricultural land.  In the satellite imagery, agricultural cleared land can be mistaken for savanna, with sparse isolated trees and a herbaceous/grassy understory.  Scenes should be marked as <b>rural/cleared</b> if there is clear evidence of agricultural activity in the surrounding area, for example, extensive fencelines, buildings, dams, and linear features such as planted lines of trees and crops or tractor furrows. Rainforest can also be confused for plantations, for example palm oil plantations, as in the example from Malaysia below. These are characterized by linear, unnatural placement of trees.  Similarly, urban areas with roads, houses and buildings should be classified as rural/cleared.</p>

  <h2>Arid and Sparse Vegetation</h2>

  <p> <img src="arid1.jpg" alt="CC Christopher Watson" align = "left" />On the drier, more arid edge of savanna regions, the vegetation becomes more open, grading into grassland with extremely sparse trees, or with trees absent all together.  Grassland itself eventually grades into desert rangeland, with xeric shrubs and bunchgrasses.  These ecosystems should be classified as <b>Arid/Sparse</b>, and are identifiable by the absence of tree canopy, and often the presence of bare, unvegetated soil.  Some dark trees and shrubs may still be present, but there should be large spaces between them, and no more than six trees within the red sampling circle at the default zoom level. Mountainous terrain, lakes (either with water or dry) and creekbeds may also be present in these regions, as may evidence of human disturbance in the form of rangeland grazing.  Fencelines and tracks may therefore be visible, but the paddocks are extremely large and the vegetation within relatively unmodified, so these areas should not be classified as rural/cleared unless disturbance is extensive or vegetation is significantly different from the surrounding areas.<img src="arid2.jpg" alt="CC George Gentry" align = "right" /></p>

  <h2>Other</h2>

  <p>There are a number of other vegetation types that you may come across in the satellite imagery.  You may occasionally be placed on ocean and wetland environments - all scenes were water or wetland dominates the classification circle should be classified as <b>Other</b>.  Mangrove ecosystems should also be classified as <b>Other</b> - like rainforests, mangrove communities are often represented by a lush, continuous deep-green canopy.  They can be distinguished from rainforest, however, by their coastal position, and the presence of numerous branching creeks and salt pans throughout the scene. Other features that may not fit into other categories include salt pans (bare and bright white) and beaches. </p>
